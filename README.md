# Iltis,

a light-weight line emission transfer code

## Requirements

You will need at least
- a C++ compiler with C++11 features
- OpenMP support is required, although you can just remove the -fopenmp option in the `Makefile` to get around this

Additionally, it is useful to have
- MPI libraries/headers to run in MPI parallel mode
- for the Python tools, you need an installation of Python 2
- for the tools that convert the output to HDF5 (in `./text2hdf5/`), you need the HDF5 library (also in the C++ flavor!), and probably you need to adapt the pathes in `text2hdf5/Makefile` 

## Installation

Set CC to your preferred C++ compiler in `Makefile` and just do `make`

## Usage

Run Iltis using

`./Iltis.exe \<inputs file\>`
  
For testing purposes, you can use the inputs file in `RegressionTests/Shell` (should also work on a Desktop)

## Known Issues


## A quick documentation

### Introduction

Iltis is a Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code specialized on the Lyman-$\alpha$ line. However, it is relatively simple to change the code to run with a different emission line. At startup, all necessary parameters for a run a read from parameter file that is given as the only argument to the executable. Besides the parameters in those files, there are a few preprocessor directives in use, mainly for the acceleration schemes implemented to speed up the RT.

The code follows Zheng et al. 2002, Laursen et al. 2009, Dijkstra et al. 2006 in terms of the RT scheme. Detailed references are given in the code.

Iltis is relatively agnostic about the way the geometry of the problem, that is, density, velocity, temperature, .., fields are configured. It is therefore not very complicated to add own datasources. In this release, only the SphericalShell, the InfiniteSlab, and the Unigrid datasource/problem type are included. An implementation for reading and using Ramses files is available on request.

### Problem/Dataset types

#### InfiniteSlab

The infinite slab is a frequently used test problem. It considers a slab of gas, infinite in two dimensions, and finite in one, with a length 2 times `boxsize`. The problem is completely specified by (colum) density, dust (column) density, and temperature. 

#### SphericalShell

The spherical shell is a well-known, simple model of LAEs pioneered by Verhamme et al. 2006. It considers a spherical shell with an inner and outer radius, a gas/dust (column) density, a temperature, and an constant outflow velocity.

#### Unigrid   

A single, fixed grid read from disk, specifying the density, dust density, temperature, and velocity field in each cell. The format of the grid file is very simple and can be understood from the example in `RegressionTests/Unigrid/testgrid.py`: In short, the first line of the file should contain a hash, followed by the linear grid size. All other lines contain the data for one cell, in this order: density, temperature, velocity, dust density, each separated by a whitespace.




### Parameters

- `dataset_type`: type of dataset used
- `seed`: the initial random seed of the simulation 
- `use_peeling_off`: set to true to enable peeling off
- `verbosity`: set to value > 1 to get more information about the progress of a simulation
- `cosmology.H0`: Hubble constant at current time. Used for calculation of Hubble rate.
- `cosmology.Omega_L`: Omega Lambda

### preprocessor parameters
#### defined in `LymanAlphaLine.H`
`USE_ACCELERATION`: use an acceleration scheme based on truncating the scattering atoms' velocitiy to avoid core scatterings
`FULL_ACC`: truncate at a fixed value of the dimensionless frequency, x, in the atom's frame. If not defined, use a scheme by Laursen et al. 2008 to dynamically determine the cutoff value
`Ã€CC_XCRIT`: the fixed value at which we truncate in case ``FULL_ACC`` is defined
`DIPOLE_SCATTERING`: instead of an isotropic phase function, use a dipole

#### defined in `BaseSimulation.H`
